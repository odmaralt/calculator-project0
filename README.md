# Calculator by Mrla

I built this responsive calculator website using Javascript, CSS, and HTML. I enjoyed designing the website and implementing the functions and learning more about using Javascript functionsc.

## Problems & Solutions üí≠

**Here are some challenges I had:**

> **Getting the decimals to work**
>
> - Whenever I clicked the decimal point, it had a bug where I would be able to click on the decimal as many times as I wanted.
> - To fix this, I added to the function so that you can only click on decimal point once.

> **Compute function**
>
> - I made the compute function so that when the user clicks equals after typing out an operation, the compute function would check to see what sign was clicked and find the answer.
